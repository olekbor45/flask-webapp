            <p>Carriage Paid To (CPT) is an Incoterm where the seller arranges and pays for the transport of goods to a named destination, but risk transfers to the buyer once the goods are handed over to the first carrier.</p> <!--Info about incoterm from ChatGPT-->
            <h3>Key Points:</h3>
            <p>1.Seller pays for main transport to the agreed destination.</p>
            <p>2.Buyer assumes risk once goods are handed to the carrier.</p>
            <p>3.Seller is also responsible for export clearance.</p>
            <p>4.Import duties, taxes, and insurance are buyer’s responsibility.</p>
            <p>It’s useful when the seller has better access to shipping arrangements but the buyer wants to manage risk or insurance themselves.</p>
